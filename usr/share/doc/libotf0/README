#	libotf -- A Library for handling OpenType Font (OTF)	    #
#								    #
#			Ver.0.9.13 (2012.08.31)			    #
#####################################################################

(1) What is libotf?

The library "libotf" provides the following facilites.

    o Read Open Type Layout Tables from OTF file.  Currently these
      tables are supported; head, name, cmap, GDEF, GSUB, and GPOS.

    o Convert a Unicode character sequence to a glyph code sequence by
      using the above tables.

The combination of libotf and the FreeType library (Ver.2) realizes
CTL (complex text layout) by OpenType fonts.

It seems that the probject Free Type Layout provides the similar (or
better) facility as this library, but currently they have not yet
released their library.  So, we have developped this one.
